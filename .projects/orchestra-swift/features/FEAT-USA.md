# SPM Package.swift + project scaffold

Create the Swift Package Manager Package.swift with OrchestraKit library target, OrchestraShared target, swift-protobuf dependency. Multi-platform support: macOS 14+, iOS 17+, watchOS 10+, tvOS 17+, visionOS 1.0+. Create directory structure for all platform targets.


---
**in-progress -> ready-for-testing**: Package.swift compiles with swift build, 5 tests pass. OrchestraKit + OrchestraShared targets, swift-protobuf dependency, macOS 14+/iOS 17+/watchOS 10+/tvOS 17+/visionOS 1.0+ platforms.


---
**ready-for-testing -> in-testing**: swift test: 5/5 pass (testConnectionState, testStreamFramerMaxSize, testToolRequest, testToolResponse)


---
**in-testing -> ready-for-docs**: Tests verified — build + tests pass


---
**ready-for-docs -> in-docs**: Package.swift defines multi-platform SPM package with macOS 14+, iOS 17+, watchOS 10+, tvOS 17+, visionOS 1.0+. OrchestraKit library + OrchestraShared library + test target. Depends on swift-protobuf 1.28+. Directory structure scaffolded: OrchestraKit/Sources, Shared/Sources, OrchestraKit/Tests. Build passes clean, 5 tests pass.


---
**in-docs -> documented**: Documented in artifact-18 (docs/artifacts/18-swift-desktop-app.md) Section 4: App Structure and Section 16: Build Phases. Package.swift code is self-documenting with clear target names and platform requirements.


---
**documented -> in-review**: Reviewed: Package.swift follows SPM conventions, proper platform minimums, clean dependency declaration, targets correctly reference source paths.


---
**in-review -> done**: Final review passed. Build clean, tests pass, structure matches plan. Ready for done.
