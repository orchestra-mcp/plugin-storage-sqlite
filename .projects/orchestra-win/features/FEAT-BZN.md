    Implement a global command palette triggered by `Ctrl+K` — searches projects, features, notes, docs, and MCP tools.

    **`CommandPalette.xaml`** — modal `ContentDialog` or custom overlay:
    - Centered, 640×480px max, `CornerRadius=12`, semi-transparent background
    - `AutoSuggestBox` with immediate focus on open, real-time results
    - Results grouped: Recent, Projects, Features, Notes, Actions
    - Keyboard navigation: arrow keys, Enter to select, Escape to close

    **Result types:**
    - `ProjectResult` → navigate to project detail
    - `FeatureResult` → navigate to project + scroll to feature
    - `NoteResult` → open note in editor
    - `ActionResult` → run MCP tool (e.g. "New Chat", "New Project", "Switch to Spirit Mode")
