    Headless and kiosk-mode support for Windows IoT Enterprise and IoT Core.

    Detection: `AnalyticsInfo.VersionInfo.DeviceFamily == "Windows.IoT"`

    Features:
    - `IoTKioskWindow.cs` — full-screen kiosk layout (no chrome), auto-start on boot
    - `HeadlessOrchestraService.cs` — Windows Service wrapper for headless operation
    - `NotificationRelayService.cs` — forward Toast notifications to remote endpoints (HTTP POST)
    - `KioskLockdownPolicy.cs` — restrict navigation to allowed plugins only (Projects + AI Chat)
    - Assigned Shell Access (ASSA) configuration for kiosk mode via PowerShell
    - Auto-reconnect QUIC connection with exponential backoff for IoT environments
    - Remote management via REST API exposed on local network (port 7890)
    - Minimal plugin set: AI Chat, Projects, Notifications relay, Health check
    - `WatchdogService.cs` — restart QUIC connection + plugin stack on failure
    - `IoTHealthPlugin.cs` — expose /health endpoint for monitoring systems
    - Package as Windows IoT Runtime Image component (wim-based deployment)
