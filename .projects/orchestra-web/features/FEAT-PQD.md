    Main dashboard and full project management with Epic → Story → Task hierarchy, sync status, and team-scoped access.

    **Dashboard** (`resources/js/pages/dashboard.tsx`):
    - Stats cards: total projects, synced devices, active tasks, completed tasks
    - Platform capabilities showcase: MCP tool count, agent count, skills count, platform icons
    - Recent projects list: name, sync_status badge (synced|syncing|error|not_synced), last_synced_at, quick actions
    - Recent notes sidebar: pinned notes at top, latest 5 notes
    - Activity feed: recent sync_log entries (what changed, when, from which device)

    **Projects** (`resources/js/pages/projects/`):
    - `index.tsx` — grid/list toggle, search, filter by team, sort by last_synced/created/name; `POST /projects` → create project modal (name, description, team selector, icon, color)
    - `show.tsx` — project detail with tab navigation:
      - **Overview**: description, stats (epics, stories, tasks, completion %), sync status card
      - **Epics**: accordion list of epics with stories inside
      - **Team Members**: member list with role badges, invite button → calls `POST /projects/{project}/team-members`
      - **Settings**: name, description, icon, color, danger zone (delete project)

    **Epic/Story/Task hierarchy** (inline in project show):
    - Epic list: `GET /api/projects/{slug}/epics` → expandable rows
    - Each epic: title, story count, status badge, expand → shows stories
    - Each story: title, task count, status, expand → shows tasks
    - Each task: title, status badge, priority badge, assignee avatar, due date
    - Inline create: "+" button at each level → inline form (no separate page)
    - Status workflow per task: todo → in-progress → done (dropdown)
    - Priority: low|medium|high|critical (colored badge)
    - All CRUD via API: `POST/PUT /api/projects/{slug}/epics/{epicId}/stories/{storyId}/tasks`
    - Drag-to-reorder within same parent (HTML5 drag or mouse events)

    **Project API Controllers** (`Api/ProjectController`, `Api/EpicController`, `Api/StoryController`, `Api/TaskController`):
    - Full CRUD for projects, epics, stories, tasks
    - `GET /api/projects/{slug}/tree` — full hierarchy in single response (for desktop/mobile)
    - `GET /api/projects/stats/tasks` — task stats across all projects

    **Notifications** (`resources/js/pages/notifications.tsx`):
    - Real-time notification bell in top nav with unread count
    - Notification list: type icon, message, timestamp, read/unread state
    - Mark read on click, mark all read button
    - Types: team_invitation, sync_conflict, subscription_expiry, task_assigned

    Acceptance: dashboard loads with real stats, projects list/create/delete works, epic/story/task hierarchy renders and supports inline CRUD, task status updates via dropdown, notification bell shows unread count
