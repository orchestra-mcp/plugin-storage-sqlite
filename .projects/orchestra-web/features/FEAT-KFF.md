    Global search and command palette using SearchSpotlight from @orchestra-mcp/search — accessible from any page via Cmd+K keyboard shortcut.

    File: `apps/web/src/components/search/spotlight.tsx`

    Implementation:
    - SearchSpotlight from @orchestra-mcp/search as the core component
    - Triggered by: Cmd+K / Ctrl+K global keyboard shortcut (useEffect on keydown)
    - Modal overlay using Modal from @orchestra-mcp/ui as backdrop

    Search categories (SearchCategory types from @orchestra-mcp/search):
    1. Projects — mcp.callTool("list_projects") filtered by query
    2. Features — mcp.callTool("search_features", {query}) across all projects
    3. Notes — mcp.callTool("list_notes") filtered by title/content
    4. Tools — filter already-loaded toolsStore.tools by name/description
    5. Prompts — filter already-loaded prompts by name
    6. Commands — static list: Go to Projects, Go to Chat, Go to DevTools, New Feature, New Note, New Chat

    Each SearchResult: title, subtitle, category, icon (BoxIcon), action (navigation or MCP call)

    Result selection:
    - Arrow keys navigate, Enter executes
    - Navigation results: router.push(path)
    - Action results: mcp.callTool(...) then toast success

    Integration into AppShell:
    - Render <Spotlight> at root of AppShell (always mounted)
    - "Search" item in sidebar with Cmd+K hint label
    - SearchSpotlight trigger button in sidebar header area

    Acceptance: Cmd+K opens spotlight, typing searches all categories, arrow keys navigate, Enter executes, Escape closes
