# Activity Log + Packs Grid + Storage Browser

Three utility pages for debugging, pack management, and .projects/ file browsing.

Activity page (`apps/web/src/pages/activity.tsx`):
- In-memory Zustand store `useActivityStore` tracking every mcp.callTool invocation
- Entry shape: {id, timestamp, method, toolName, durationMs, success, errorMessage}
