# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Orchestra MCP is an AI-agentic IDE targeting 5 platforms: Desktop (Wails), Chrome Extension, Mobile iOS, Mobile Android, and Web Dashboard. Built with Go (Fiber v3 + GORM), Rust (Tonic gRPC + Tree-sitter + Tantivy), and React/TypeScript (pnpm + Turborepo + Zustand).

The old Laravel codebase is preserved at `old-ref/` for reference. All new development happens in the repo root.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Development

make dev-go              # Go server only (air hot-reload)
make dev-rust            # Rust engine only (cargo watch)
make dev-frontend        # All frontends via Turborepo

# Build
make build               # Build everything (Go + Rust + MCP + frontends)

## Architecture

### Plugin System (Component-First)

Everything is a plugin. The plugin runtime at `app/plugins/` provides:
- **Plugin interface** with capability contracts (Has* interfaces)
- **PluginManager** with topological dependency sort and boot sequence
- **FeatureManager** for runtime feature flags — disable any feature by turning off its plugin
- **ServiceRegistry** for plugin-scoped dependency injection
- **ContributesRegistry** for VS Code-style contributions (commands, menus, settings)

Each plugin is a standalone Go module with its own `go.mod`, pushable as a separate GitHub repo. Plugin folder convention: `config/`, `providers/`, `src/`, `resources/`, `README.md`.

### MCP Plugin (Pure Go, 85 tools)

The first plugin at `plugins/mcp/`. Provides project management tools via MCP protocol:
- **Build**: `cd plugins/mcp && go build -o orchestra-mcp ./src/cmd/`
- **Run**: `orchestra-mcp --workspace .` (stdio JSON-RPC)
- **Init**: `orchestra-mcp init --workspace .` (creates .mcp.json, .projects/, .claude/, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, CONTEXT.md)
- **Packages**: `types/`, `toon/`, `workflow/`, `helpers/`, `transport/`, `tools/`, `engine/`, `bootstrap/`
- **Workflow**: 13-state lifecycle (backlog → todo → in-progress → ready-for-testing → in-testing → ready-for-docs → in-docs → documented → in-review → done)
- **Multi-Audience PRD**: 4 audience types (business/product/technical/qa) with conditional follow-up questions, validation, agent briefings, auto-backlog generation, and reusable templates
- **Sprint Management**: Create/start/end sprints with auto task promotion (backlog→todo), velocity tracking, burndown charts, standup summaries, retrospectives
- **Parallel Agents**: `get_next_task` supports `epic_id`, `story_id`, `assignee`, `label` filters for scoped agent work
- **WIP Limits**: Configurable max in-progress tasks (global + per-assignee), enforced on `set_current_task`
- **Dependencies**: Task dependency graph with blocker/blocked-by relationships
- **Engine**: Optional Rust gRPC engine for vector search memory (auto-starts/stops, TOON fallback)
- **Extensible**: Other plugins push tools via `RegisterExternalTools()` — appears in stdio + REST

### Three-Layer Database

- **PostgreSQL** (cloud) — Source of truth. pgvector for embeddings, JSONB for settings, tsvector for full-text search, partitioned sync_log
- **SQLite** (local) — Offline support on Desktop and Mobile. Managed by Rust engine (rusqlite) and WatermelonDB (React Native)
- **Redis** — Real-time pub/sub for sync, session cache, rate limiting

### Sync System

All syncable entities use UUID primary keys and include `version`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`. Changes are logged to `sync_log` and published via Redis pub/sub. Clients push local changes and pull remote changes via WebSocket. Conflict resolution: last-write-wins with version vectors.

### Go Backend (Fiber v3 + GORM)

REST API, WebSocket sync hub, job queue, auth (JWT). Architecture: Handlers → Services → Repositories. All data mutations go through SyncService to log changes.

### Rust Engine (Tonic gRPC)

CPU-intensive operations: Tree-sitter parsing, Tantivy search indexing, file diffing, content hashing, zstd compression, AES-256-GCM encryption, local SQLite management. Go communicates with Rust via gRPC.

### React Frontends (pnpm + Turborepo + Zustand)

Five apps share `@orchestra/shared` (types, stores, hooks, API client) and `@orchestra/ui` (shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS v4 theme). Platform-specific code stays in each app directory.

## User Interaction Rule (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS use the `AskUserQuestion` tool when you need user input.** Never print questions as plain text and wait for a response. The scrum-master agent and project-manager skill must use `AskUserQuestion` for:
- PRD session questions (present MCP question via `AskUserQuestion`, then pass answer to `answer_prd_question`)
- Sprint planning decisions (sprint goal, dates, scope)
- Architecture and design choices
- Priority and scope decisions
- Any clarification or confirmation needed from the user

## Sub-Agent Orchestration Rules

Sub-agents (launched via the `Task` tool) do **NOT** have access to MCP tools. They cannot call `advance_task`, `set_current_task`, or any workflow tools. The main agent must own the full task lifecycle.

### Rules

1. **Sub-agents are for code writing ONLY** — Use sub-agents only during the `in-progress` phase to write code. They return code results, nothing more.
2. **Main agent owns the lifecycle** — The main agent (you) must handle ALL gate transitions: test, document, review. Never delegate gate work to a sub-agent that can't call MCP tools.
3. **One task at a time** — Work one task through its FULL lifecycle (in-progress → done) before starting the next. Never batch multiple tasks in parallel through gates.
4. **Summarize sub-agent results** — After a sub-agent returns, summarize what it built to the user before advancing. The user must see what happened.
5. **Never mark done without gates** — After a sub-agent writes code, YOU must: run tests (Gate 1), verify coverage (Gate 2), write docs (Gate 3), review quality (Gate 4). Each gate needs real evidence.

### Correct Pattern

```
1. set_current_task(task_id)                    → in-progress
2. Delegate code writing to sub-agent (Task tool)
3. Sub-agent returns → summarize results to user
4. Run tests yourself or delegate to qa-* agent
5. advance_task(evidence="test results...")     → ready-for-testing [GATE 1]
6. advance_task                                  → in-testing
7. Verify coverage and edge cases
8. advance_task(evidence="coverage...")          → ready-for-docs [GATE 2]
9. advance_task                                  → in-docs
10. Write documentation yourself
11. advance_task(evidence="docs...")             → documented [GATE 3]
12. advance_task                                 → in-review
13. Review code quality yourself
14. advance_task(evidence="review...")           → done [GATE 4]
15. Move to next task
```

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

- Spawning 5 sub-agents in parallel, then batch-advancing all 5 tasks to done
- Letting a sub-agent "handle everything" including testing and docs
- Advancing through gates without providing real evidence
- Starting the next task before the current one reaches done

## Conventions

### Go
- Handler methods: `Index`, `Show`, `Store`, `Update`, `Delete`
- Services contain business logic; repositories are pure data access
- All entities use UUID primary keys with `SyncModel` base
- Error responses: `{"error": "code", "message": "...", "details": {}}`
- Always pass `context.Context` through the call chain
- Use interfaces for services (testability)

### Rust
- Use `thiserror` for typed errors, `anyhow` for application errors
- Never use `unwrap()` in production — use `?` operator
- Use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for CPU-heavy synchronous work
- Proto code via `tonic-build` in `build.rs` (not buf for Rust)
- Logging via `tracing` crate

### TypeScript/React
- Import types with `type` keyword
- Zustand stores: separate `State` and `Actions` interfaces
- Use `@orchestra/*` aliases, never relative `../../../` cross-package
- All API responses typed with `ApiResponse<T>`
- Functional components only, `FC` for typing

### Database
- All syncable entities: UUID PK + version + timestamps + soft delete
- PostgreSQL: `TIMESTAMPTZ`; SQLite: ISO 8601 strings
- JSONB for flexible metadata, never for queried fields
- Never store file contents in DB — use content_hash + object storage
